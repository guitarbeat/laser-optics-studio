Draft your initial prompt or ideas for a project here. Use this to then kickstart the project with the cursor agent mode when using the agile workflow, documented in docs/agile-readme.md. After the initial prd is drafted, work with the LLM in cursor or with an external LLM to ask questions, have the LLM ask you questions, etc., to really define an adequate prd and story list. Then continue with generating of the architecture document to ensure the project is built in a way that is easy to maintain and scale as you need it to be, along with a clear specification of what technologies and libraries you want to use. This will also help you figure out what rules you might want to initial generate to help you build the project.

Example:

Let's build an application for automating the creation of optics diagrams for my lab presentations. I need a tool that lets me quickly design laser setups, optical paths, and experimental configurations to share during lab meetings. The application should have an intuitive interface that allows me to drag and drop common optical components (mirrors, beam splitters, lenses, lasers, detectors, etc.) onto a canvas and connect them to show beam paths. Each component should have configurable properties (focal length, wavelength, angle, etc.) that affect the visual representation and potentially the simulation of the optical system.

I want the ability to save diagrams to a library for reuse, export them as high-quality images suitable for presentations (PNG, SVG), and possibly annotate them with text and measurements. The tool should come with a comprehensive library of standard optical components used in laser labs, but also allow me to create custom components. It would be great if the application could provide basic simulation capabilities to show how light would realistically propagate through the system. The UI should be clean and professional, making it possible to create publication-quality diagrams in minutes rather than hours.

Ideally, the application would be desktop-based or a web app that works offline, as I might need to use it in the lab without internet. I'd like a feature that lets me share diagrams with colleagues or export them directly to presentation software. Since some of our setups are complex, the tool should scale well to handle large diagrams without performance issues.

{ The more details to drive the initial prd draft the better! BUT, you don't have to think of everything up front, get the draft prd done, and then use the AI to communicate with as a PRD expert, and then an architecture expert to further flesh out the details! Also be open to allowing the AI expert to suggest libraries and technology choices if there is something you are not too particular about. Some apps may be better suited to the one you know best, and this can also help you get exposure and learn new technologies. Consider using deeper web research so you are not constrained to the LLM of choice internal knowledge cut offs, you can enable this through MCP to expand the llm capabilities to use perplexity, tavily, or basic web searches to ensure you will be using the latest and greatest available models and libraries. It is also recommended if doing this in Cursor to select the Sonnet or Deepseek Thinking Agent modes, or use a mcp plugin that supports deeper thought. }
