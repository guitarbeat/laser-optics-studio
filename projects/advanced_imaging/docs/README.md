# Advanced Imaging System Project

This project contains schematics and documentation for an advanced optical imaging system.

## Components

- Light source
- Beam expander
- Focusing optics
- Imaging lenses
- Detector/camera

## Schematics

- `imaging_system_schematic.tex` - Complete imaging system setup

## Usage

To build all files in this project:

```bash
make project-advanced_imaging
```

To build a specific file:

```bash
# Example:
make build/advanced_imaging/schematics/imaging_system_schematic.pdf
```

## Notes

This project demonstrates more complex optical setups with multiple components and beam paths.
